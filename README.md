## Now serving!
 - [x] [Crabrave](https://crabrave.vercel.app) - TypeScript Enums. But good.

## What's cooking?

 - [ ] progress.cafe - A to-do list that doesn't miss the bigger picture nor the finest details. (initially rxdb+couch to be replaced in the future by hammock)
 - [ ] Hammock - Kick back. TypeScript CouchDB client and eventual PouchDB replacement. (I would call it couchbase but someone took that name already and sofabase just doesn't roll off the tounge ya know)
 - [ ] Passport - more info soon! (soon is in valve time)
 - [ ] kvcm.live 2.0 - Almost done, but I need a different host for the radio stream. (we're on break for the holidays, I think)

## Considering adding to the menu
 - [ ] Stream poll thingy - Shows Twitch polls in real-time in a browser source. (I'd like to add YouTUbe as well but their API *sucks* whereas with Twitch you just join a public IRC room to read messages. I might legit need a relay server for YouTube.)
 - [ ] Tailscale UI - I'd like to have a UI on Linux!
 - [ ] Caddy UI - I'd generally just like to have a UI for Caddy
 - [ ] wanwan - WaniKani client, will probably pick it back up when I start properly studying Japanese again.

## Currently Taking
*the progress bars will be back when I have a nicer way of integrating them!*
 - [ ] Designing Data Intensive Applications (Kleppmann)
 - [ ] Deep Learning for Coders with fastai & PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD (https://course.fast.ai)

## Completed
 - [Harvard CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x) ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/100/)
 - [nand2tetris Part 1](https://nand2tetris.org) ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/100/)
 - [The Rust Programming Language (static skim)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book) ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/100/)

## Planned
 - Hardware
   - [Tiny Tapeout](https://tinytapeout.com/)
   - [Zero to ASIC](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/)
   - [Embedded Discovery Book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/microbit/)
 - Software
   - [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)
   - [Ziglings](https://github.com/ratfactor/ziglings) (because rust can't interface with c when using wasm yet)
   - [Operating System development tutorials in Rust on the Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials)
   - The C Programming Language
 - Math (no clue where to even start tbh)
