## ⑨/⑨ Update

Over the summer, I managed to get 2 W grades, which is kinda bad, I guess. However, I effectively completed CS50 as well, excluding the final project! I just need to stop being lazy and write a simple webpage and then I can progress to the final assignment and then the looming Final Project.

Speaking of the final project, I built an alpha version of Heatchess, without any prior planning, which was definitely a mistake. The code looks like something YanDev might wave written. Next up, I will be rewriting from scratch, employing a modular architecture as that's what really killed the alpha. Unsure when I will actually be doing this as I'd rather start working on Field, and for that I need to complete CS50's Web Development course.

Now that the Fall semester has started I'm not sure how exactly I'll be managing the workload of those classes and everything else I'm taking. However, I do think I'll have no problems passing all of the classes I'm taking, despite taking a ridiculous amount to begin with.

Transfer season is nearly here, though I'm not sure if I actually want to apply to anything. The programs I do want to apply to require higher math than I have right now for the most part, and every math class in my school district seems to employ Proctorio or similar, so that's a no-go.

Right now I'm in Turkey for various reasons, which hopefully doesn't end up being a problem when it comes to school things. But hey, if they want me to use Proctorio over a 2G connection, that's their problem, not mine.
