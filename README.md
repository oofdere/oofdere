## End of Semester Report (Spring 2021)
Missed two finals, definitely failed VFX by not turning anything in, classic me move. I expect overall GPA to be somewhere between 3.4-3.7 because of this. Low Budget Production is still kind of up in the air, as is Linux. Somehow got a B in VO, much confidence gained.

Transferring is really up in the air at this point. Still no broadcast/video engineering degrees to be found in the United States. I'll probably end up taking or self-teaching CS/CE, but am very behind on the math, so that'll take at least three years if I go university route.

## Up next
 - nand2tetris
 - HtDP/Beautiful Racket
 - Math For Programmers and/or 3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development
