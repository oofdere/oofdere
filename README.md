## Hi! I'm Tibet!

I like making things, particularly things that make it possible for people to make, share, and remix other things.

I take great pride and joy in helping people make and do things. 

Big fan of Svelte, Nix, Elixir, Gleam, Rust, etc. Not a big React/Next fan.

I currently work on [Unikara](https://unikara.moe), some secret projects, and have worked on/off on [Aiko](https://aikocorp.ai) and [Dingboard](https://dingboard.com)

Feel free to reach out for whatever reason via [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/183423435114938368) or [Twitter](twitter.com/oofdere).
