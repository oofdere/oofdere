I really love broadcasting. All our other mediums are asynchronous: movies, books, podcasts, etc.

But broadcasting is live. It is in the moment. You are in sync with other people, sometimes millions, and sometimes just one or two.

Even when it's a "fake" broadcast just playing something that's already been recorded back, you still get to experience that you're watching this together with other people, and thanks to the internet, you can genuinely be watching it with complete strangers in real-time. Sure, the content might be pre-recorded or it might be available for streaming afterwards, and you might get a replay of the chat, but that specific screening, that specific moment, can only happen once.

It feels like we've been losing that. Have any of us felt the way people watching the moon landings did, for instance? Have any of us experienced a [Max Headroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Headroom_signal_hijacking) or a [Captain Midnight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Midnight_broadcast_signal_intrusion)? When was the last time a broadcast felt special to you?

For me, it was the Secret Sky festival. I caught almost the whole thing, and while it was all pre-recorded, it felt live, just watching the Twitch chat reacting with poggers and ayayas and other nonsense in real-time. Virtual YouTubers are pretty cool too. (elaborate)

But before that, who knows? The most vivid one that comes to mind was the airing of the SpongeBob Atlantis episode. The DVR was borken, and I cried about it a lot. I ended up missing it, so I cried some more. And then it got re-aired, so that was fine. Point is, I was less than 10 years old at the time. And that is my most significant broadcasting memory, which is just depressing.

Thankfully, the medium is coming back in full-swing: Gone are frequency allocations and call signs and huge metal towers, replaced with a magical box connected to a magical cable, or maybe even no cable at all. Now we have a cottage industry of broadcasters. Sure, most of them are anime girls, but who cares, for the longest time broadcasting had no graphics at all.

And of course, should none of the waifus provide the content you want, you can just make your own content, whether that be [making novelty keycaps](https://www.twitch.tv/tiny), [repairing MacBooks](https://www.twitch.tv/rossmanngroup), or [giving mental health advice](https://www.twitch.tv/healthygamer_gg).

The other really exciting development in independent broadcasting is [Web Monetization](https://webmonetization.org/), a native way to monetize content on the web. The most exciting thing about Web Monetization is its simplicity. To monetize, all you have to do is change one line of code on your website. To pay for content, all you need to do is use a payment provider. Right now, the only choice is [Coil](https://coil.com/), which is $5 a month and pays for the amount of time spent on the website, but expect more providers to show up once Web Monetization gains traction. Right now, Web Monetization is mainly limited to small tech blogs, but higher profile users include Twitch and some of the Conde Nast network, including [WIRED](https://wired.com). 

Anyways, if you've ever been interested in broadcasting, or getting your voice heard or creating content, now is the time to get in.

We're at ground zero.
